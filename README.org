#+TITLE: Virtual Machines Configuration

* What is this?

This is a set of [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html][ansible playbooks]] for system post-installation configuration, /primarly/ for use within virtual machines ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/][Hyper-V]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]], etc.).
- The goal *IS NOT* a /newbie-friendly/ environment. The only objective is a small system that is reasonably fast with low resources usage (CPU, RAM, etc.).
- Not every virtual machine *requires* a graphical environment (backup server, penetration testing, media server, etc.). If you use *several* *dedicated* virtual machines (i.e. "a la" [[https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/][Qubes OS]]), not installing a UI saves resources.

  The default shell is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell][Ksh]], the [[https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1][OpenBSD flavor]].

* What is required?

- Supported operating systems: Linux ([[https://voidlinux.org/][Void Linux]]) and BSD ([[https://www.openbsd.org/][OpenBSD]])
- Package dependencies (the package name might vary from one OS or Linux distribution to another):
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)][ansible]]: In order to run the provided ansible playbooks.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git][git]]: To pull additional repositories (/including this one/) from revision control.

* How do I use this?

Please run the following commands in a terminal.

** Clone this repository

#+begin_src sh
   git clone https://github.com/yveszoundi/vms-setup.git
   cd vms-setup
#+end_src

** Apply configurations

You can customize defaults as you please (=vars= directory), and then run one of the following commands:
- For Linux, run =ansible-playbook -v voidlinux_playbook.yml -K=.
- For OpenBSD, run =ansible-playbook -v openbsd_playbook.yml -K=.

** Finish the setup

 Once you're done with the above, wrap-up the configuration:
 - Open a terminal from the console (i.e. =CTRL-ALT-F2=).
 - Login with the newly created user =vip= and the password =vip123= (see the =vars= directory).
 - Please update your password immediately... (=passwd= command).
 - Logout using the =exit= command.
 - Go to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDM_(display_manager)][XDM]] display manager window, if it's started and enabled (i.e. =CTRL-ALT-F7=).
 - Authenticate and you'll notice that you're inside the dwm window manager.
 - Type =CTRL-t-k= to close =xconsole=.
 - You can read more about the relevant [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/dwm-customization][dwm customizations on Github]].

* What's next?

- Likely support for MacOS, FreeBSD.
- Probably no support for Windows, as I don't /really/ use that OS (Hyper-V, Emacs, CMD prompt, File Explorer, Browser, what else???).
